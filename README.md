This is a simple PowerShell function to get switch mac address table for a specific VLAN.
To execute you first need to install and import the Proxx.SNMP module (https://github.com/Proxx/Proxx.SNMP).

Tested on Cisco Catalyst, Cisco Small Business (48-port) and HP Procurve devices.

You can include the function in your own ps1 script.
